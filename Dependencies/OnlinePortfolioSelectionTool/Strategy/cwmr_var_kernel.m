% This program output the final portfolio the CWMR-Var algorithm
% CWMR has only one experts, thus, we go expert directly.
% If we want buy and hold, combine the experts here.
% This version is the deterministic version, while stochastic version can
% change one line of the code, as indicated below.
%
% function [weight, mu, sigma] = cwmr_var_kernel(data, mu, sigma, phi, epsilon)
%
% weight: final portfolio, used for next rebalance
% mu: next portfolio mean
% sigma: next diagonal covariance matrix
%
% data: market sequence vectors
% mu: last portfolio mean
% sigma: last diagonal covariance matrix
% phi: confidence parameter
% epsilon: mean reversion threshold
%
% Example: [weight, mu, sigma] ...
%          = cwmr_var_kernel(data, mu, sigma, phi, epsilon)
