% Bk has multiple experts, thus, we combine them in the kernel file.

% function [weight, exp_w] = bnn_kernel(data, K, L, exp_ret, exp_w)
%
% weight: final portfolio, used for next rebalance
% exp_w: today's individual expert's portfolio
%
% data: market sequence vectors
% K: maximum window size
% L: splits into L parts, in each K
% exp_ret: historical cumulative return used to weight the portfolios
% exp_w: experts' last portfolios
%
% Example: [weight, exp_w] = bnn_kernel(data, K, L, exp_ret, exp_w);
