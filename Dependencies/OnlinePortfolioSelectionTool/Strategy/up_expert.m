function [weight] = up_expert(data, weight_o)
% This program generates portfolio for a specified parameter setting.
% Refer to KV02
%
% function [weight] = up_expert(data, k, l, c)
%
% weight: experts portfolio, used for next rebalance/combination
%
% data: market sequence vectors
% weight_o: last portfolio, also can be last price relative adjusted.
%
% Example: [weight] = up_expert(data, weight_o);
