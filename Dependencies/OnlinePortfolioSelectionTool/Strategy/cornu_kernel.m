% This program output the final portfolio the CORNU algorithm
% Rather than CORN, CORNU has multiple experts
% And we combine them in this kernel file.

% function [weight, exp_w] = cornu_kernel(data, K, L, c, exp_ret, exp_w)
%
% weight: final portfolio, used for next rebalance
% exp_w: today's individual expert's portfolio
%
% data: market sequence vectors
% K: maximum window size
% L: splits into L parts, in each K
% c: similarity threshold
% exp_ret: historical cumulative return used to weight the portfolios
% exp_w: experts' last portfolios
%
% Example: [weight, exp_w] = cornu_kernel(data, K, L, c, exp_ret, exp_w);
